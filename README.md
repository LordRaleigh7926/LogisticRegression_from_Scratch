# Logistic Regression Model Repository

This repository contains an implementation of logistic regression for binary classification in Python. It includes a logistic regression model (`LogisticRegression.py`), a test script (`test.py`), and is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

## Usage

To use the logistic regression model, follow the steps outlined in the test script (`test.py`). Make sure to have the `LogisticRegression.py` file in the same directory as the test script.

### Example Usage

```bash
python test.py
```

### Files
- LogisticRegression.py: Contains the implementation of the logistic regression model including training and prediction methods.
- test.py: Test script demonstrating the usage of the logistic regression model with sample data.
- LICENSE: GNU General Public License (GPL) specifying the terms under which the code is distributed.

### Output
The test script prints the predictions, model weights, and model bias after training the logistic regression model with the sample data.
